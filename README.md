ðŸ“˜ Project Overview: Predicting Prostate Cancer Using Biopsy Results
What is Prostate Cancer?
Prostate cancer is a common cancer in men that develops in the prostate â€” a small gland responsible for producing seminal fluid. Most prostate cancers grow slowly and remain confined to the gland, but some can be aggressive and spread quickly. Early detection is critical for effective treatment and long-term survival.
 What is a Biopsy?
A prostate biopsy is a medical procedure where small samples of tissue are removed from the prostate and examined under a microscope to determine whether cancer cells are present.
Biopsy results typically fall into two categories:

0 = Benign (no cancer)
1 = Malignant (cancer cells present)


 Why Predict Biopsy Results?
While biopsies are the gold standard for diagnosis, they are:
Invasive
Costly
Not always necessary (many men with elevated PSA do not have cancer)


This project explores whether we can use non-invasive patient data â€” like:
PSA level
Urinary symptoms
Medical history
Age, BMI, lifestyle to predict the outcome of a biopsy.


The goal is to:
Support early cancer detection
Reduce unnecessary biopsies
Help doctors prioritize high-risk patients


 Our Target:
Weâ€™ll train a machine learning model to predict the Biopsy_Result column using pre-diagnostic patient data. This allows us to simulate an intelligent screening tool that flags patients at higher risk for malignancy.
